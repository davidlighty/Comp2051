Assignment 1
=============

All tasks will work, in order, from one page.  This page will not have anything more than the basic HTML5 skeleton (head/body).  All other elements and interaction will come from Javascript.  There will be no jQuery used for any of these either.

We will use a few utility script files to enhance the output/progress.  One will be the utility "statusMsg", which we will use like a console to output a log of things happening through out the javascript.

Tasks 1-4 are all in index.html.
Then I branched out into different files for more complicated tasks.
