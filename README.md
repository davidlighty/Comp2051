Repository for all labs, assignments & projects in this class.

Assignments
-----------

These are the weekly tasks/labs that we need to accomplish.  Each of these will be in their own js file, some will have a coorosponding html file to run the task.  My approach was to keep to the aspect that the js will write out 90% of the html to the page.  So the only real different in HTML files is the reference to the js file.

I did change the call to the js file from mainModule to labModule at one point.
